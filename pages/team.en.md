## The MorelCorp Team

Alright, let's be honest: currently, "the team" at MorelCorp is just me. But hey, at least we never have conflicts during team meetings! ðŸ˜„

description="Hello! I'm Jean-FranÃ§ois, and after 15 years building teams and products across varied contexts, I've developed a passion for helping organizations navigate their technical and human challenges.

My journey has taken me from dental labs (Straumann, medical devices) to creative studios at Ubisoft, through artificial intelligence at Coveo and industrial robotics at AGT. This diversity of experience is my strength: I've seen how the same fundamental principles apply differently depending on context, and most importantly, I've learned that technology is never the real challenge.

What really gets me excited? Transforming frustrated teams into teams that deliver with confidence. Helping leaders align their technical vision with their business objectives. Creating environments where agility becomes natural rather than forced.

I grew up in Quebec but shaped my leadership vision working with distributed teams around the world. I speak fluent _dev_, fluent _business_, and most importantly, I translate between the two.

My philosophy? A high-performing team is a team that understands where it's going and why. Everything else can be built.

If you recognize your organization in my past challenges, or if you simply want to chat about technical leadership over coffee (or beer), I'd love to connect with you."
